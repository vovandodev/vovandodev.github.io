See the vsphere-client-virgo.log for more details.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just before that I removed a test vcenter server, which was connected to my PSC  on production Vsphere instance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You need to remove a stale vCenter Server from your SSO environment, use the cmsso-util. It may takes a long time but does the job.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
